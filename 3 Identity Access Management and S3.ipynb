    "It is important to understand IAM and how it works, both for the exam and for adiminstrating a company's AWS account in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features of IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity Access Management offers the following features:\n",
    "- centralised control of your AWS account\n",
    "- shared access to your AWS account\n",
    "- granular permissions\n",
    "- identity federeation (including active dir like Facebook, google)\n",
    "- multifactor authentication\n",
    "- provide temporary access for users/ devices and services where necessary\n",
    "- allows you to set up your own password rotation policy\n",
    "- integrates with many different AWS services\n",
    "- supports PCI DSS Compliance (credit card framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terminology for IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users: \n",
    "    - end users sch as people, employees of an organization etc\n",
    "- Groups:\n",
    "    - a collection of users. Each user in the group will inherit the permissions of the group\n",
    "- Policies:\n",
    "    policies are made up of documents, called policy documents\n",
    "- Policiy Documents:\n",
    "    - documents are in JSON and give permission as to what a User/Group/Role is able to do\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Roles\n",
    "    - you create roles and then assign them to AWS resources"

    "### What is S3?\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what is S3?\n",
    "- S3 is a safe place to store your files\n",
    "- it is object-based storage\n",
    "- the data is spread across multiple devices and facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### The basics of s3 are:\n",
    "- S3 is object-base and allows you to upload files\n",
    "    - Key: or filename of the object\n",
    "    - Value: the data being stored\n",
    "    - Version Id: important for versioning\n",
    "    - Metadata: data about your data\n",
    "    - Subresources:\n",
    "        - access control lists\n",
    "        - torrent \n",
    "    \n",
    "- files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB\n",
    "- There is unlimited storage\n",
    "- files are stored in buckets (sort of like folders)\n",
    "- S3 is a universal namespace, that is names must be unique globally\n",
    "    - this is because it creates a web addressed based on its name\n",
    "    - given as https://bucketname.regionlocation.amazonaws.com/\n",
    "- when you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTPP 2-- code f the upload was successful\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does data consistency work for S3?\n",
    "- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects\n",
    "    - if you upload a file to S3, you are able to read it immediately\n",
    "- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take time to propagate)\n",
    "    - if you change the file, you will have to wait for it to update. will get an eariler version if it is not ready\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words;\n",
    "- if you write a new file and read it immediately aftwards, you will be able to view that data\n",
    "- if you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version, or you may not. Changes to objects can take time to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 has the following guarantees from Amazon;\n",
    "- built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform\n",

    "    - stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently\n",
    "2. S3 - IA (infrequently Accessed)\n",
    "    - for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieval fee\n",
    "3. S3 One Zone -IA\n",
    "    - for where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently access data, but do not require the multiple availability zone data resilience\n",
    "4. S3 - Intelligent Tiering\n",
    "    - optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier without performance impact or operational overhead\n",
    "5. S3 Glacier\n",
    "    - a secure, durable and low-cost storage class for data archiving. you can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.\n",
    "6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive\n",

    "- not suitable to install an operating system or databsase on, will want block based storage for that. S3 is object based storage\n",
