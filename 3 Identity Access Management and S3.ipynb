    "IAM - allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand IAM and how it works, both for the exam and for adiminstrating a company's AWS account in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features of IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity Access Management offers the following features:\n",
    "- centralised control of your AWS account\n",
    "- shared access to your AWS account\n",
    "- granular permissions\n",
    "- identity federeation (including active dir like Facebook, google)\n",
    "- multifactor authentication\n",
    "- provide temporary access for users/ devices and services where necessary\n",
    "- allows you to set up your own password rotation policy\n",
    "- integrates with many different AWS services\n",
    "- supports PCI DSS Compliance (credit card framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key terminology for IAM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users: \n",
    "    - end users sch as people, employees of an organization etc\n",
    "- Groups:\n",
    "    - a collection of users. Each user in the group will inherit the permissions of the group\n",
    "- Policies:\n",
    "    policies are made up of documents, called policy documents\n",
    "- Policiy Documents:\n",
    "    - documents are in JSON and give permission as to what a User/Group/Role is able to do\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Roles\n",
    "    - you create roles and then assign them to AWS resources"
