    "### What is EC2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud\n",
    "- EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change\n",
    "\n",
    "### aws pricing \n",
    "\n",
    "AWS pricing philosophy- You pay as you go, you pay for what you use,  pay less as you use more, and pay even less when you reserve capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "### EC2 pricing models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On Demand: allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment\n",
    "2. Reserved: provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance\n",
    "    - Contract Terms are 1 Year or 3 Year teams\n",
    "3. Spot: Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, provding for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.\n",
    "4. Dedicated Host: physicall EC2 server dedicated for your use.\n",
    "    - helps you reduce cost by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### on demand pricing is useful for\n",
    "\n",
    "- users that want the low cost and flexibility of EC2 without up-front payment or long-term commitment\n",
    "- applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted\n",
    "- applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time\n",
    "\n",
    "### reserve pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "- applications with steady state or predictable usage\n",
    "- applications that require reserved capacity\n",
    "- users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing cost even further\n",
    "\n",
    "### reserve pricing types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standard reserved instances: offer up to 75% off on demand instances. The more you pay up front the longer the contract, the greater the discount\n",
    "2. Convertible reserved instances: these offer up to 54% off on demand capability to change the attribute of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value\n",
    "3. Scheduled reserved instance: available to launch within the time windows you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week, or a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spot pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "- applications that have flexible start and end times\n",
    "- applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices\n",
    "- users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "### dedicated hosts pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "- useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization\n",
    "- great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployment\n",
    "- can be purchased On-Demand (hourly)\n",
    "- can be purchased as reservation for up to 70% off the price\n",
